# Future Improvements & Mentor Feedback

### **The Hard Truth: Not Bad, But Not Bold Enough**  

Your analysis is **good**, structured well, and has actionable insights. But “good” doesn’t get jobs—**exceptional** does. Right now, it reads like a **competent but safe** report. The problem? It lacks **bold, standout insights** that make decision-makers say, “We need this person.”  

Hiring managers don’t just want to see trends. They want to see **money-making insights** that drive action. Your report hints at this, but it needs **more depth, sharper insights, and a stronger impact focus.**

### **Specific Fixes to Elevate This Report**  

✅ **1. Strengthen the Business Impact of Insights**  
Your recommendations are solid, but they need to **hit harder.** Instead of saying:  
- “Leverage Holiday Sales Peaks” → **“Maximize holiday revenue by increasing prices on top-selling products by 10% during peak months, which could drive an extra €2M in revenue.”**  
- “Reduce Off-Season Revenue Drops” → **“Introducing targeted winter promotions in February could recover at least €500K in lost revenue.”**  

💡 **Fix:** Add **concrete numbers** to your insights. Business leaders think in revenue, margins, and profitability. **If you don’t quantify impact, your insights lack weight.**

✅ **2. Show Profitability, Not Just Revenue**  
Right now, your report focuses on **sales volume and revenue**, but **profit matters more.**  
- Which products are high-revenue but low-profit?  
- Which regions generate the most **profitable** sales?  
- Do B2B discounts eat into margins too much?  

💡 **Fix:** Add a simple profitability analysis. Even an estimate based on unit price vs. discount trends can **reveal hidden profit killers.**

✅ **3. Find a Hidden Growth Opportunity**  
The best analysts **go beyond surface trends.** Right now, you’ve identified key revenue drivers, but **what is an overlooked strategy that could drive exponential growth?**

- **Product Bundling:** Would **pairing underperforming products with top sellers** increase sales?  
- **Regional Expansion:** Are there **emerging regions** with untapped demand?  

💡 **Fix:** Add **one “aha!” insight**—a hidden opportunity that isn’t obvious. This makes you **stand out.**
